## Contract for Intellectual Property Protection ⚖️

The following contract written in **Solidity** is designed to protect the intellectual property of the Akiles Stack Manager.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract IntellectualPropertyProtection {

    address public owner;
    string public propertyName;
    string public description;
    uint256 public creationDate;

    // Event for IP Protection Registration
    event PropertyRegistered(address indexed owner, string propertyName, uint256 creationDate);

    // Constructor to set the initial owner and property details
    constructor(string memory _propertyName, string memory _description) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        propertyName = _propertyName;
        description = _description;
        creationDate = block.timestamp;
        emit PropertyRegistered(owner, propertyName, creationDate);
    }

    // Modifier to check if the caller is the owner of the intellectual property
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not the owner");
        _;
    }

    // Function to update the description of the property
    function updateDescription(string memory _description) public onlyOwner {
        description = _description;
    }

    // Function to transfer ownership
    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
        owner = newOwner;
    }

    // Function to get property details
    function getPropertyDetails() public view returns (string memory, string memory, uint256) {
        return (propertyName, description, creationDate);
    }
}
```

### Description:

- **Owner**: The owner of the intellectual property is registered at the contract's creation.
- **Property Name & Description**: Defines the intellectual property being registered.
- **Creation Date**: A timestamp marking when the intellectual property was registered.
- **Events**: Emit events when new intellectual property is registered.
- **OnlyOwner Modifier**: Allows only the owner to modify the contract.

This contract ensures that the ownership and protection of intellectual property are maintained and provides the capability to transfer ownership if necessary. 🔒
